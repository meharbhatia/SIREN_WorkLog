**1st June 2018**

Reading the book "Ontology Learning and Population from Text" and the algorithms mentioned till chapter 4.
Start implementation from Monday.

**4th June 2018**

Understanding and implementing the algorithms. Implementation of first algorithm (Naive FCA Algorithm) done

**5th June 2018**

Implemented second algorithm (Ganter's FCA Algorithm). Started to implement the next one

**6th June 2018**

Read about clustering in unsupervised problems and have implemented the third algorithm (K Means Algorithm). Started to implement the next ones which are on hierarchical clustering.

**7th June 2018**

Read about Hierarchical clustering approaches like Agglomerative Clustering, Divisive Clustering and Bi-Section KMeans. 

**8th June 2018**
Reading chapter 6 of the book that looks into concept hierarchy induction and the common approaches to learning the concept hierachies.
Read about the apporoach based on FCA which groups and hierarchically orders words or terms according to use or behaviour in corpus. Need to implement Algorithm 7 where we will form the lattice from the respective document and hence the concept hierarchy.
